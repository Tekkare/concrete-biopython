Indeed, as data is often very sensitive in bioinformatics, using **FHE** garanties full end to end privacy of the data and of its processing.  \n",

    "As a second application, we will look in FHE for the [**origin of replication**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_replication) in a DNA strand. The **origin of replication** (also called the **replication origin**) is a particular sequence in a genome at which **replication** is initiated, used when a cell divides. This area of the genome sometimes needs to be analyzed, but it needs to be found first.  \n",

However, around the **origin of replication**, the proportion of guanine and thymine (G and T) **is greater** than the proportion of adenine and cytosine (A et C). This particularity is helpful to find the approximate localisation of the origin of replication.  \n",

To that extent, we first create a lookup table to map letters 'G' to a 1 and letters 'C' to a -1, the other letters 'A' and 'T' being mapped to 0. Then, we sum up the values throughout the sequences, and keep the first index of the minimum value of this cumulated sum. We also return the whole cumulated sum array for plotting."

    "\n",
    "### Comparing two sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "As we already saw, <span style=\"color:green\">**Seq**</span> and <span style=\"color:orange\">**FheSeq**</span> classes implement some operators such as **len(**seq**)**, seq**[i:j]**,  or s1**==**s2. They also implement the comparison operators s1 **>** s2, s1 **>=** s2 and their opposite s1 **<** s2, s1 **<=** s2.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the <span style=\"color:green\">**Seq**</span> class, a sequence **A** is lower than another sequence **B** (noted *A<B*) if **A** is alphabetically lower than **B** (and not equal to B). The first character is compared first:  \n",
    "- If *A[0] < B[0]* then *A < B*\n",
    "- Else, if *A[0] > B[0]* then *A > B*\n",
    "- Else, *A[0] = B[0]*, so the second character is compared, and so on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, `Seq('AB')` is lower than `Seq('AC')`. Also, `Seq('AA')` is lower than the `Seq('AAA')` because the empty character at the end is considered alphabetically lower than all other characters. The <span style=\"color:orange\">**HfeSeq**</span> class works with the same principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ranking a list of sequences:\n",
    "With such comparison operators, we are able to sort a list of sequences. On clear data, it is possible to use `sorted(sequence_list)` to sort a list of sequences, but in FHE, this is impossible. Indeed, `sorted()` uses **if** conditions to order the sequences in a new **list** object. In FHE, because **if** conditions are forbidden, we cannot create a new ordered list. However, we can create an array where each index contains the rank of the sequence at this index.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we can build a comparison matrix. Suppose our list of sequences is the following : `seqlist = ['CAA', 'AAB', 'CAA', 'AA', 'AAA']`, and we want an ascending ranking. In our comparison matrix, we will compute `comp_matrix[i,j] = seqlist[i]<seqlist[j]` when `i<j`(upper half), and `seqlist[i]>=seqlist[j]` equal to `1-comp_matrix[i,j]` when `j<i` (lower half).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can sum up the results on each row to get how many other sequences are lower than the sequence of the row, which gives exactly the ranking of this sequence in the list. Note that even though two identical sequences are provided, they get each a different rank, which is preferable (this is because we used `seqlist[i]>=seqlist[j]` instead of `seqlist[i]>seqlist[j]`).\n",
